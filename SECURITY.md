# Github Sign-In for Rails: Security

Security is of utmost importance in an authentication library like Github Sign-In for Rails. We at Happybuild use this plugin in our own apps, so we have a vested interest in investigating and mitigating all reported vulnerabilities. We welcome responsible security reviews and reports from our peers in the open-source software community and strive to acknowledge such valuable contributions.


## Reporting a vulnerability

Send urgent or sensitive reports to **<security@happybuild.com>**. We’ll get back to you as soon as we can—usually within one business day. Please follow up if you don’t hear back. For non-urgent or non-sensitive requests, please contact our support team.
